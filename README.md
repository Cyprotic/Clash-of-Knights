# Clash-of-Knights
Made using Unity's Unet (deprecated) this multiplayer game support a multiple class system and a capture the flag gamemode. Comes together with a promotional website and a scoreboard on both the application and the website for player to check their scores and compare with the world.

Needs a MYSQL database for registration and login, use unity's Unet system to find a match and the other network functionalities, sadly it is all deprecated but it should still be working fine.
